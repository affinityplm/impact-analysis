What does it do?  
  
the impact analysis tool is an application that records all the dependencies between your engineering data. For example, it records the drawings needed for welding procedure, or the sub components needed to assemble an installation. 
  
Once these depdendencies are recorded, the impact analysis tool will let you know if proecedures are using out of date information, or it will let you know how many downstream processes will be affected by your engineering change.
